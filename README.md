> Plastic Box Mod for Minetest

This is a fork of the original mod by @cheapie that makes the `moreblocks` dependency optional, and adds a new reverse crafting recipe (thanks, @bell07!).

It adds a recolourable plastic box node (try using the _Dye Airbrush_ on it!).

To use, simply clone this repository into your `worldmods` folder.

## License
Cheapie's original mod was WTFPL, but in order to avoid the risk of being sued and other undesirable scenarios, I'm releasing this under the [MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/), which is almost as permissive. The full text is in the `LICENSE` file in the root of this repository.
